# RTL Cookbook

Compilation of useful RTL modules written in SystemVerilog.

The goal is to include explanations similar to those found in the old [Altera Advanced Synthesis Cookbook](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/content-details/654474/advanced-synthesis-cookbook.html), but to include explanations about primitive mappings that are more relevant for today's FPGAs, e.g., AMD/Xilinx Ultrascale+, etc.

## Progress

I will track my progress here, outlining in a similar fashion as the Altera cookbook.
